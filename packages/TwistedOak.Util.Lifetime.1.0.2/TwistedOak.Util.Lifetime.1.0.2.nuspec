    <description>A small library that implements an improved version of System.Threading.CancellationToken with support for removable registrations, to allow for garbage collection in the presence of long-lived tokens, plus some related utilities.

Motivation: cancellation tokens can be the source of memory "leaks", because an unbounded number of completed operations may have registered now-pointless callbacks on a token that can't be released or cancelled. The callbacks may reference all kinds of data, preventing effective garbage collection. Using a Lifetime allows fixing these issues because callback registrations can be given lifetimes of their own.

Additional utilities: LifetimeSource, LifetimeExchanger, DisposableLifetime, Max, Min, CreateDependentSource.</description>
